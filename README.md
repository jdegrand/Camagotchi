# Camagotchi

## Overview
A remake of the famous Tamagotchi toy,the digital pet simulator, written in C. The program utilizes the ncurses and multithreading libraries to recreate this experience.

## Future Plans
I hope to add more features and more growth stages to the Camagotchi, and plan to 3D print a case and run the program on a Rapberry Pi Zero. I want to buttons to it so it mimics an actual Tamagotchi toy. I also want to optimize the program and change the length of all of the growth cycles so that it is more like that of a Tamagotchi

## Instructions
Navigate to the folder  
1. `make`  
1. `./camagotchi`
